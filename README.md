Agoric's [SES shim][ses-shim], Sujitech's [ahead-of-time-SES][AOT-SES] and
Moddable's [XS][xs-compartments] are actively vetting this proposal
as a shim and native implementation respectively (2022).
Most activity toward advancing this proposal occurs on those projects.

## Synopsis

Provide a mechanism for evaluating modules from ECMAScript module source code
and virtualizing module loader host behaviors.

This proposal is a [SES Proposal][ses-proposal] milestone.

## Motivation

Many ECMAScript module behaviors are defined by the host.
The language needs a mechanism to allow programs running on one host to fully
emulate or virtualize the module loader behaviors of another host.

Module loader behaviors defined by hosts include:

* resolving a module import specifier to a full specifier,
* locating the source for a full module specifier,
* canonicalizing module specifiers that refer to the same module instance,
* populating the `import.meta` object.

For example, on the web we can expect a URL to be a suitable full module
specifier, and for every module specifier to correspond to a URL.
We can expect the canonicalized module specifier to be reflected as
`import.meta.url`.
In Node.js, we can also expect import specifiers that are not fully qualified
URLs to receive special treatment.
However, in Moddable's XS engine, we can expect a module specifier
to resemble a UNIX file system path and not have a corresponding URL.

We can also expect to have only one module instance per canonical module
specifier in a given Realm, and for `import(specifier)` to be idempotent
for the lifetime of a Realm.
Tools that require separate module memos are therefore compelled to create
realms either using Node.js's [VM context][vm-context] or `<iframes>` and
[content security policies][csp] rather than a lighter-weight mechanism,
and consequently suffer identity discontinuties between instances from
different realms.

Tools that will benefit from the ability to have multiple module graphs
in a single realm include:

* bundlers ([Browserify][browserify], [WebPack][webpack], [Parcel][parcel],
  &c), virtualize loading but not evaluation of module graphs and emulate other
  host environments, like a Node.js program emulating a web browser.
* import mappers ([import-map][import-map]) like bundlers need to be able to
  collect transitive dependencies according to ECMAScript language and specific
  host behaviors.
  A ECMAScript native module loader interface would expedite evolution of import map
  runtimes in JavaScript.
* hot module replacement (HMR) systems (WebPack, SnowPack, &c), which need the
  ability to instantiate new module graphs when dependencies change and the
  ability to bequeath subgraphs to new graphs.
  * Node.js [defers][node-hmr] to ECMAScript to provide a module loader
    interface to aid HMR.
* persistent testing apparatuses ([Jest][jest]), because a persistent service
  reinstantiates whole module graphs to reconstruct tests and test subjects.
  * Jest currently resorts to exploiting Node.js's [vm][vm-context] module to
    instantiate separate realms and attempts ([and
    fails][jest-ses-interaction]) to provide the illusion of a single realm by
    patching client realms with some of the intrinsics of the host realm.
* emulators ([JSDom][jsdom]) in which the emulated artifact may need a separate
  module memo from the surrounding realm.
* sub-realm sandboxes ([SES][ses] and [LavaMoat][lava-moat]) that virtualize
  evaluating guest modules and limit access to globals and built-in modules.
  This proposal prepares for the SES proposal to introduce `lockdown`, which
  isolates all evaluators, including `eval`, `Function`, and this `Compartment`
  module evaluator. That proposal will introduce the concern of per-compartment
  globals and hardened shared intrinsics.

Defining a module loader in the language also improves the language's ability
to evolve.
For example, a module loader interface that accounts for linking "virtual"
modules that are not JavaScript facilitates easier experimentation with linkage
against languages like WASM.
For another, a module loader interface allows for user space experimentation
with the notion of [import maps][import-map].

Defining a module loader in the language also provides valuable insight to the
design of every language feature that touches upon modules, and every new
module system feature adds uncertainty to the eventual inclusion of a module
loader to the language.

One such insight is that module blocks will benefit from the notion of a module
descriptor as defined by this proposal. Module blocks roughly correspond to
compiled sources and are consequently not coupled to a particular host environment.
A module descriptor is necessary to carry properties of a module not captured
in the source, like the module referrer specifier and how to populate `import.meta`.

Additionally, having a module loader interface is a prerequisite for shimming built-in
modules.

### Sketch

Below is a rough sketch of potential interfaces.

* A "module instance" consists of a "module exports namespace", a "module
  environment record", and a "static module record".
* A "module exports namespace" is an exotic object that represents the exported
  namespace of a module as already specified in ECMA 262.
  This proposal does not alter module exports namespaces.
* A "module environment record" is the scope into which a module imports names
  from other modules and exports names to other modules.
  This proposal reifies a module environment record as an exotic object that
  virtual modules can use to implement bindings.
  An `import name as alias` binding will have a property with the lexically bound alias.
  An `export name as alias` binding will have a property with the lexically bound name,
  whereas the module exports namespace will have a property with the alias.
  The environment record does not contain a property for any names that are
  imported and reexported without a lexical binding.

```ts
type ModuleExportsNamespace = Record<string, unknown>;
type ModuleEnvironmentRecord = Record<string, unknown>;

// Bindings reflect the `import` and `export` statements of a module.
// A statement with multiple clauses decomposes into multiple bindings.
type Binding =

  // import { X } from 'X';
  // import { X as Y } from 'X';
  { import: string, as?: string, from: string } |

  // export { X }
  // export { X as Y }
  // export { X } from 'X';
  // export { X as Y } from 'X';
  { export: string, as?: string, from?: string } |

  // import * as X from 'X';
  { importAllFrom: string, as: string } |

  // export * from 'X';
  // export * as X from 'X';
  { exportAllFrom: string, as?: string };

// Compartments support ECMAScript modules and linkage to other kinds of modules,
// notably allowing for JSON or WASM.
// VirtualStaticModuleRecord is a *protocol* that compartments recognize if
// the `record` property of a ModuleDescriptor is neither a string nor
// an object that passes a StaticModuleRecord brand check.
// These amy provide an initializer function and may declare bindings for
// imported or exported names.
// The bindings correspond to the equivalent `import` and `export` declarations
// of an ECMAScript module.
type VirtualStaticModuleRecord = {
  // Indicates the import and export bindings the module has
  // between its module environment record, module exports namespace,
  // and its dependencies.
  bindings?: Array<Binding>,

  // Initializes the module if it is imported.
  // Initialize may return a promise, indicating that the module uses
  // the equivalent of top-level-await.
  // XXX The compartment will leave that promise to dangle, so an eventual
  // rejection will necessarily go unhandled.

    import?: (importSpecifier: string) => Promise<ModuleExportsNamespace>,
    importMeta?: Object
  }) => void,

  // Indicates that initialize needs to receive a dynamic import function that
  // closes over the referrer module specifier.
  needsImport?: boolean,

  // Indicates that initialize needs to receive an importMeta.
  needsImportMeta?: boolean,

  // Indicates if the initialize function returns a promise.
  isAsync?: boolean,
};

// Static module records are an opaque token representing the compilation
// of a module that can be reused across multiple compartments.
interface StaticModuleRecord {
  // Static module records can be constructed from source.
  // XS allows virtual module records and source descriptors to
  // be precompiled as well.
  constructor(source: string);

  // Static module records reflect their bindings for information only.
  // Compartments use internal slots for the compiled code and bindings.
  bindings: Array<Binding>;

  // Indicates that initialize needs to receive a dynamic import function that
  // closes over the referrer module specifier.
  needsImport?: boolean,

  // Indicates that initialize needs to receive an importMeta.
  needsImportMeta?: boolean,

  // If the module is async (containing top level await)
  isAsync?: boolean,
}

// A ModuleDescriptor captures a static module record and per-compartment metadata.
type ModuleDescriptor =

  // Describes a module by referring to a *reusable* record of the compiled
  // source.
  // The static module record captures a static analysis
  // of the `import` and `export` bindings and whether the source ever utters
  // the keywords `import` or `import.meta`.
  // The compartment will then asynchronously _load_ the shallow dependencies
  // of the module and memoize the promise for the
  // result of loading the module and its transitive dependencies.
  // If the compartment _imports_ the module, it will generate and memoize
  // a module instance and initialize the module.
  // To initialize the module, the compartment will construct an `import.meta` object.
  // If the source utters `import.meta`,
  // * The compartment will construct an `importMeta` object with a null prototype.
  // * If the module descriptor has an `importMeta` property, the compartment
  //   will copy the own properties of the descriptor's `importMeta` over
  //   the compartment's `importMeta' using `[[Set]]`.
  // The compartment will then begin initializing the module.
  // The compartment memoizes a promise for the module exports namespace
  // that will be fulfilled at a time already defined in 262 for dynamic import.
  | {
    record: StaticModuleRecord,

  // [[ModuleEnvironmentRecord]] and [[ModuleExportsNamespace]] based
  // entirely on the bindings array of the virtual static module record.
  // If the virtual static-module-record has a true `needsImport`, the
  // compartment will construct an `import` that resolves
  // the given import specifier relative to the module instance's full specifier

  // imported module.
  // If the virtual static-module-record has a true `needsImportMeta`
  // property, the compartment will construct an `importMeta` by the
  // same process as any { source } module.
  // `importMeta` will otherwise be `undefined`.
  // The compartment will then initialize the module by calling the
  // `initialize` function of the virtual static module record,
  // giving it the module environment record and an options bag containing
  // either `import` or `importMeta` if needed.
  // The compartment memoizes a promise for the module exports namespace
  // that is fulfilled as already specified in 262 for dynamic import,
  // where the behavior if the initialize function is async is analogous to
  // top-level-await for a module compiled from source.

  // Otherwise, loading induces the parent compartment to load the module,
  // but does not induce the parent compartment to load the module's transitive
  // dependencies.
  // This compartment then resolves the shallow dependencies according
  // to its own resolveHook and loads the consequent transitive dependencies.

```

## Motivating Examples and Design Rationales

### Multiple-instantiation

This example illustrates the use of a new compartment to support multiple
instantiation of modules, reusing the host's compartment and static module record
memos as a cache.
This example creates five instances of the example module and its transitive
dependencies.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
  new Compartment().import('https://example.com/example.js');
}
```

Assuming that the language separately adopted hypothetical `import static`
syntax to defer execution but load a module and its transitive dependencies, a
bundler would be able to observe the need to capture the example module and its
transitive dependencies, such that the *only* instances are in guest compartments.

```js
import static 'https://example.com/example.js';
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
  new Compartment().import('https://example.com/example.js');
}
```

### Virtualized web compartment

This example illustrates a very reductive emulation of a web-based compartment.
The module specifier domain is strictly URLs and import specifiers are resolved
relative to the referrer module specifier using URL resolution.
The compartment populates `import.meta.url` with the response URL.

The compartment also ensures that the import specifiers of whatever module is
loaded get resolved relative to the physical location of the resource.
If the response URL shows that the fetch followed redirects, the `loadHook`
returns a reference (`{instance: response.url}`) to the actual module instead
of returning a record.
The compartment then follows-up with a request for the redirected location.

```js
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url, { redirect: 'manual' });
    if (response.url !== url) {
      return { instance: response.url };
    }
    const source = await response.text();
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      importMeta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

By returning an alias module descriptor, the compartment can ensure
that requests for both the request URL and the response URL refer
to the canonicalized module.

---

For the same intended effect but a single fetch, we might
alternately use a `specifier` property of record module descriptors.
In the following example, both the request URL and the response URL
would realize cache keys in the compartment.

```js
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const source = await response.text();
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      specifier: response.url,
      importMeta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

So, we guide the host to instead return the new cache key so the compartment
can memoize the `loadHook`, sending a single request for the canonicalized
module specifier.

A design tension with the `specifier` property is that it invites a race
between two concurrent `loadHook` calls for different specifiers that
converge on the same response specifier.
Implementations must take care to ensure that the module record memo and the
module record *promise* memo point to the same record for a given ultimate full
specifier.


### Bundling or archiving

Compartments can be employed to virtualize a foreign environment and generate
bundles, archives, or other stored forms of a program for transmission and
deferred execution.

This first snippet is a minimal bundler.
It differs from the first minimal example only in that it generates a `sources`
Map and calls `load` instead of `import`, ensuring we do not attempt to run any
of the loaded code locally.

```js
const sources = new Map();
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(fullSpecifier) {
    const response = await fetch(fullSpecifier);
    const source = await response.text();
    sources.set(fullSpecifier, source);
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.load('https://example.com/example.js');
```

Then, we presumably serialize the `sources` map and recreate it in another
environment.
This next figure uses the `sources` to reconstruct the original compartment
compartment module graph and execute it.

```js
const evaluator = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  loadHook(fullSpecifier) {
    const source = sources.get(fullSpecifier);
    if (source === undefined) {
      throw new Error('Assertion failed: incomplete sources');
    }
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await evaluator.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

### Inter-compartment linkage

One motivating use of compartments is to isolate Node.js-style packages and
limit their access to powerful modules and globals, to mitigate software supply
chain attacks.
With such an application, we would construct a special compartment for each package
and allow compartments to link modules across compartment boundaries.

In this trivial example, we construct a pair of compartments, `even` and `odd`,
which in turn contain mutually dependent `even` and `odd` modules that
participate in a dependency cycle.
For simplicity, the domain of module specifiers is exactly the names `even` and
`odd`, and these compartments do not support resolution.

These compartments use `{ instance, compartment }` module descriptors to indicate
linkage across compartment boundaries.

```js
const even = new Compartment({
  resolveHook: specifier => specifier,
  loadHook: async specifier => {
    if (specifier === 'even') {
      return { record: new StaticModuleRecord(`
        import isOdd from 'odd';
        export default n => n === 0 || isOdd(n - 1);
      `) };
    } else if (specifier === 'odd') {
      return { instance: specifier, compartment: odd };
    } else {
      throw new Error(`No such module ${specifier}`);
    }
  },
});

const odd = new Comaprtment({
  resolveHook: specifier => specifier,
  loadHook: async specifier => {
    if (specifier === 'odd') {
      return { record: new StaticModuleRecord(`
        import isEven from 'even';
        export default n => n !== 0 && isEven(n - 1);
      `) };
    } else if (specifier === 'even') {
      return { instance: specifier, compartment: even };
    } else {
      throw new Error(`No such module ${specifier}`);
    }
  },
});
```

An alternative design that Agoric's SES shim and XS's native Compartment
explored used module exports namespace objects as handles that could be passed
between compatment hooks.
However, to support the bundler use case, it became necessary to add a method
that could get a module exports namespace object for a module that had not yet
been loaded (`compartment.module(specifier)`, much less instantiated, nor
initialized.
The invention of a module descriptor allowed us to remove this complication,
among others: the `moduleMapHook` became superfluous since both the `modules`
constructor option and the `loadHook` could use module descriptors instead.

### Linking with a virtual record (JSON example)

To support non-JavaScript languages, a compartment provides a `loadHook` that
returns virtual-static-module-record implementations.
This example virtual-static-module-record declares its bindings (equivalent to
`export default` in this case) and provides an initializer.
The initializer receives a module environment record according to the shape
declared in its bindings.
This compartment makes the simplifying assumption that all modules are JSON.
A more elaborate version of this example will switch on the response MIME type
and account for import assertions.

```js
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(fullSpecifier) {
    const response = await fetch(fullSpecifier);
    const source = await response.text();
    const record = {
      bindings: [
        {export: 'default'},
      ],
      initialize(env) {
        env.default = JSON.parse(source);
      }
    };
    return { record };
  },
});
await compartment.import('https://example.com/example.json');
```

### Thenable Module Hazard

An exported value named `then` can be statically imported, but dynamic import
confuses the module namespace for a thenable object.
The resolution of the promise returned by dynamic import, in this case, is the
eventual resolution of the thenable module.
And the eventual resolution is unlikely to be an intended effect.

Consider `thenable.js`:

```js
export function then(resolve) {
  resolve(42);
}
```

A neighboring module might dynamically import this.

```js
import('./thenable.js').then((x) => {
  // x will be 42 in this case, not a module namespace object with a then
  // function.
})
```

This is the behavior of a dynamic import today, despite it being surprising.

We have chosen to embrace this hazard since it would be worse to have
dynamic import and compartment import behave differently.

However, with `compartment.importNow`, a program can mitigate this hazard.
With `importNow`, the following program will not invoke the `then`
function exported by `'./thenable.js'`.

```js
await compartment.load('./thenable.js');
const thenableNamespace = compartment.importNow('./thenable.js');
