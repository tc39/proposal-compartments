Agoric's [SES shim][ses-shim], Sujitech's [ahead-of-time-SES][AOT-SES] and
Moddable's [XS][xs-compartments] are actively vetting this proposal
as a shim and native implementation respectively (2022).
Most activity toward advancing this proposal occurs on those projects.

## Synopsis

Provide a mechanism for evaluating modules from ECMAScript module source code
and virtualizing module loader host behaviors.

This proposal is a [SES Proposal][ses-proposal] milestone.

## Motivation

Many ECMAScript module behaviors are defined by the host.
The language needs a mechanism to allow programs running on one host to fully
emulate or virtualize the module loader behaviors of another host.

Module loader behaviors defined by hosts include:

* resolving a module import specifier to a full specifier,
* locating the source for a full module specifier,
* canonicalizing module specifiers that refer to the same module instance,
* populating the `import.meta` object.

For example, on the web we can expect a URL to be a suitable full module
specifier, and for every module specifier to correspond to a URL.
We can expect the canonicalized module specifier to be reflected as
`import.meta.url`.
In Node.js, we can also expect import specifiers that are not fully qualified
URLs to receive special treatment.
However, in Moddable's XS engine, we can expect a module specifier
to resemble a UNIX file system path and not have a corresponding URL.

We can also expect to have only one module instance per canonical module
specifier in a given Realm, and for `import(specifier)` to be idempotent
for the lifetime of a Realm.
Tools that require separate module memos are therefore compelled to create
realms either using Node.js's [VM context][vm-context] or `<iframes>` and
[content security policies][csp] rather than a lighter-weight mechanism,
and consequently suffer identity discontinuties between instances from
different realms.

Tools that will benefit from the ability to have multiple module graphs
in a single realm include:

* bundlers ([Browserify][browserify], [WebPack][webpack], [Parcel][parcel],
  &c), virtualize loading but not evaluation of module graphs and emulate other
  host environments, like a Node.js program emulating a web browser.
* import mappers ([import-map][import-map]) like bundlers need to be able to
  collect transitive dependencies according to ECMAScript language and specific
  host behaviors.
  A ECMAScript native module loader interface would expedite evolution of import map
  runtimes in JavaScript.
* hot module replacement (HMR) systems (WebPack, SnowPack, &c), which need the
  ability to instantiate new module graphs when dependencies change and the
  ability to bequeath subgraphs to new graphs.
  * Node.js [defers][node-hmr] to ECMAScript to provide a module loader
    interface to aid HMR.
* persistent testing apparatuses ([Jest][jest]), because a persistent service
  reinstantiates whole module graphs to reconstruct tests and test subjects.
  * Jest currently resorts to exploiting Node.js's [vm][vm-context] module to
    instantiate separate realms and attempts ([and
    fails][jest-ses-interaction]) to provide the illusion of a single realm by
    patching client realms with some of the intrinsics of the host realm.
* emulators ([JSDom][jsdom]) in which the emulated artifact may need a separate
  module memo from the surrounding realm.
* sub-realm sandboxes ([SES][ses] and [LavaMoat][lava-moat]) that virtualize
  evaluating guest modules and limit access to globals and built-in modules.
  This proposal prepares for the SES proposal to introduce `lockdown`, which
  isolates all evaluators, including `eval`, `Function`, and this `Compartment`
  module evaluator. That proposal will introduce the concern of per-compartment
  globals and hardened shared intrinsics.

Defining a module loader in the language also improves the language's ability
to evolve.
For example, a module loader interface that accounts for linking "synthetic"
modules that are not JavaScript facilitates easier experimentation with linkage
against languages like WASM.
For another, a module loader interface allows for user space experimentation
with the notion of [import maps][import-map].

Defining a module loader in the language also provides valuable insight to the
design of every language feature that touches upon modules, and every new
module system feature adds uncertainty to the eventual inclusion of a module
loader to the language.

One such insight is that module blocks will benefit from the notion of a module
descriptor as defined by this proposal. Module blocks roughly correspond to
compiled sources and are consequently not coupled to a particular host environment.
A module descriptor is necessary to carry properties of a module not captured
in the source, like the module referrer specifier and how to populate `import.meta`.

Additionally, having a module loader interface is a prerequisite for shimming built-in
modules.

### Sketch

Below is a rough sketch of potential interfaces.

* A "module instance" consists of a "module exports namespace", a "module
  environment record", and a "static module record".
* A "module exports namespace" is an exotic object that represents the exported
  namespace of a module as already specified in ECMA 262.
  This proposal does not alter module exports namespaces.
* A "module environment record" is the scope into which a module imports names
  from other modules and exports names to other modules.
  This proposal reifies a module environment record as an exotic object that
  synthetic modules can use to implement bindings.
  An `import name as alias` binding will have a property with the lexically bound alias.
  An `export name as alias` binding will have a property with the lexically bound name,
  whereas the module exports namespace will have a property with the alias.
  The environment record does not contain a property for any names that are
  imported and reexported without a lexical binding.

A compartment privately retains references to:

* A global object
* A global environment record
* A static module record promise memo
* A static module record memo
* A module instance promise memo
* A module instance memo
* A resolve hook
* A load hook
* An import meta hook

Every realm retains in itself an intrinsic compartment, with a host-defined global
environment, resolve hook, load hook, and import meta hook.
Every constructed compartment (guest) by default shares the global object, global
environment record, resolve hook, load hook, and *static* memos of its host.
Compartment constructor options may override these defaults.

Compartments accept a `globals` option.
If provided, the guest compartment will create its own empty global object with a
null prototype and derive its own global environment record from that object.
The compartment will then create an intrinsic `eval`, `Function`, and `Compartment` that
refer back to the global environment record, such that scripts and modules
evaluated in the compartment share this global environment record and such that
direct `eval` in the compartment can succeed.
The compartment then copies the enumerable own properties of the `globals` option
onto the new `globalThis` using `[[Set]]`.

The Compartment constructor accepts host-virtualization hooks for loading behavior
including a `resolveHook`, `loadHook`, `importMetaHook`,and a `modules` record.
If a Compartment constructor receives any of these options, the Compartment constructor
will prepare new, empty memos, and adopt the provided host-virtualization hooks.
The `loadHook` can still adopt entries from the host's memos by returning
a descriptor that refers to them by their full specifier.

## Motivating Examples and Design Rationales

### Multiple-instantiation

This example illustrates the use of a new compartment to support multiple
instantiation of modules, reusing the host's compartment and static module record
memos as a cache.
This example creates five instances of the example module and its transitive
dependencies.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
  new Compartment().import('https://example.com/example.js');
}
```

Assuming that the language separately adopted hypothetical `import static`
syntax to defer execution but load a module and its transitive dependencies, a
bundler would be able to observe the need to capture the example module and its
transitive dependencies, such that the *only* instances are in guest compartments.

```js
import static 'https://example.com/example.js';
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
  new Compartment().import('https://example.com/example.js');
}
```

### Virtualized web compartment

This example illustrates a very reductive emulation of a web-based compartment.
The module specifier domain is strictly URLs and import specifiers are resolved
relative to the referrer module specifier using URL resolution.
The compartment populates `import.meta.url` with the response URL.

The compartment also ensures that the import specifiers of whatever module is
loaded get resolved relative to the physical location of the resource.
If the response URL shows that the fetch followed redirects (or symbolic links
for a filesystem analogy), the `loadHook` returns a reference to the actual
module instead of returning a record.
The compartment then follows-up with a request for the redirected location.

> This example is fictitious to the extent that the `'manual'` mode for
> `redirect` [does not actually reveal the redirect location][redirect-manual]
> on `response.url`, presumably because that would be too useful.

```js
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url, { redirect: 'manual' });
    if (response.url !== url) {
      return { instance: response.url };
    }
    const source = await response.text();
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

By returning an alias module descriptor, the compartment can ensure
that requests for both the request URL and the response URL refer
to the canonicalized module.

---

For the same intended effect but a single fetch, we might
alternately use a `specifier` property of record module descriptors.
In the following example, both the request URL and the response URL
would realize cache keys in the compartment.

```js
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(url) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const source = await response.text();
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      specifier: response.url,
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

So, we guide the host to instead return the new cache key so the compartment
can memoize the `loadHook`, sending a single request for the canonicalized
module specifier.

A design tension with the `specifier` property is that it invites a race
between two concurrent `loadHook` calls for different specifiers that
converge on the same response specifier.
Implementations must take care to ensure that the module record memo and the
module record *promise* memo point to the same record for a given ultimate full
specifier.


### Bundling or archiving

Compartments can be employed to virtualize a foreign environment and generate
bundles, archives, or other stored forms of a program for transmission and
deferred execution.

This first snippet is a minimal bundler.
It differs from the first minimal example only in that it generates a `sources`
Map and calls `load` instead of `import`, ensuring we do not attempt to run any
of the loaded code locally.

```js
const sources = new Map();
const compartment = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  async loadHook(fullSpecifier) {
    const response = await fetch(fullSpecifier);
    const source = await response.text();
    sources.set(fullSpecifier, source);
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await compartment.load('https://example.com/example.js');
```

Then, we presumably serialize the `sources` map and recreate it in another
environment.
This next figure uses the `sources` to reconstruct the original compartment
compartment module graph and execute it.

```js
const evaluator = new Compartment({
  resolveHook(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier) {
    return new URL(importSpecifier, referrerSpecifier).href;
  },
  loadHook(fullSpecifier) {
    const source = sources.get(fullSpecifier);
    if (source === undefined) {
      throw new Error('Assertion failed: incomplete sources');
    }
    return {
      record: new StaticModuleRecord(source),
      meta: { url: response.url },
    };
  },
});
await evaluator.import('https://example.com/example.js');
```

### Thenable Module Hazard

An exported value named `then` can be statically imported, but dynamic import
confuses the module namespace for a thenable object.
The resolution of the promise returned by dynamic import, in this case, is the
eventual resolution of the thenable module.
And the eventual resolution is unlikely to be an intended effect.

Consider `thenable.js`:

```js
export function then(resolve) {
  resolve(42);
}
```

A neighboring module might dynamically import this.

```js
import('./thenable.js').then((x) => {
  // x will be 42 in this case, not a module namespace object with a then
  // function.
})
```

This is the behavior of a dynamic import today, despite it being surprising.

We have chosen to embrace this hazard since it would be worse to have
dynamic import and compartment import behave differently.

However, with `compartment.importNow`, a program can mitigate this hazard.
With `importNow`, the following program will not invoke the `then`
function exported by `'./thenable.js'`.

```js
await compartment.load('./thenable.js');
const thenableNamespace = compartment.importNow('./thenable.js');
```
